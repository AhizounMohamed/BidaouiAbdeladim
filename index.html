        <h2></h2>
        <p>I am Dr. Abdelaadim Bidaoui, an Associate Professor of Arabic and French within the Department of Modern Languages and Classics at Ball State University. My academic journey includes earning a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.</p>

		<p>My research areas span Sociolinguistics, Pragmatics, and Second Language Acquisition. Currently, I am deeply engaged in projects focusing on discourse markers in Arabic and exploring the influence of motivation on the learning process.</p>

		<p>Teaching is my passion, and I take joy in delivering Arabic and French classes. I adopt a student-centered and communicative approach, creating activities that empower students to use the target language and engage with their peers. Beyond language courses, I contribute to the Honors College, where I introduced a course delving into the Arabic language, culture, and identity.</p>

		<p>My Honors class aims to cultivate cross-cultural awareness, fostering an understanding of differences and encouraging students to critically evaluate and compare their own cultural practices with those in the Arab world. In my holistic approach to education, I seamlessly integrate communication into teaching, exploration into scholarship, and guidance and support into service.</p>
